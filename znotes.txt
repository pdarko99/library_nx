//how do i flatten the directories im using the --flatt

//how do i generate specific files such as pipe.ts and service or models


why do they use the list(immutable one) and whenever they 
always want to create a new list instead of mutating 
to be able to use onpush


// how do i add elf instead of manually intalling them

//differnce between saving them in signals and persist state cuz they both tend to lose data 
//after refresh


//since we are not mutating the data, when we change a data which has already been added as a fav
//it doesn't get updated or changed 


//difference between getAllEntities and SelectAllEntities
//why is it that the pipe doesn't listen to reaction when i change them
//for the store in the crud app tried replicating the same thing
//i did with component store but it doesn't work and how does the set instead
//the componenet store know which todo am working with
//update entitiesl and and update all entitie how does it really work which instead
//id is it talking about here
//can i be tracking the loading state when updating a todo
//Immutable js we use it mostly when items are many and we dont wnat to duplicate(making a new refrence) hence 
//it does that for us
